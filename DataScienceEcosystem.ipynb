    "1. **Python:** Python is one of the most widely used languages in the field of data science. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, make it a versatile choice for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R:** R is another popular language among data scientists, particularly for statistical analysis and data visualization. It provides a rich set of packages like ggplot2 and dplyr that cater specifically to data manipulation and exploration tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL:** While not a general-purpose programming language, SQL (Structured Query Language) is crucial for working with databases. Data scientists often use SQL to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data stored in relational databases efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Julia:** Julia is gaining popularity in the data science community due to its high performance and simplicity. It's designed for numerical and scientific computing and offers features that are similar to both Python and R.\n"
